# <b><span style='color:#78D118'>|</span> Overview</b>

 In this notebook, we will use Weaviate as our vector database. We will then write the embedding vectors out to Weaviate and query for similar documents. Weaviate provides customization options, such as to incorporate Product Quantization or not (refer [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#hnsw-with-product-quantizationpq)). 
 
[Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/) has an enterprise offering for Weaviate.
